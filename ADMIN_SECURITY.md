# Goldeneye Admin Security Documentation

## üîê Admin Panel Protection

The Goldeneye admin panel is now protected by a comprehensive multi-factor authentication system that prevents unauthorized access and protects sensitive operations.

## üö™ Access Control System

### **Primary Authentication**
- **YubiKey Required**: Admin access requires a YubiKey enrolled as an admin key
- **Session Management**: 30-minute session timeout with activity tracking
- **Failed Attempt Protection**: Account lockout after 3 failed attempts (15-minute lockout)
- **HTTPS Enforcement**: WebAuthn requires secure connection (localhost simulation available)

### **Authentication Flow**
1. **Initial Access**: Visiting `/admin.html` shows authentication screen
2. **YubiKey Challenge**: System prompts for YubiKey insertion and touch
3. **Session Creation**: Successful auth creates encrypted session in localStorage
4. **Admin Panel Access**: Full admin functionality becomes available
5. **Activity Monitoring**: Sessions expire after 30 minutes of inactivity

## üîí Sensitive Operations Protection

### **Re-Authentication Required**
These operations require YubiKey re-authentication (after 10 minutes of inactivity):

- **üóëÔ∏è Key Deletion**: Delete any enrolled YubiKey
- **üí• System Reset**: Complete data wipe
- **üîÑ Backup Restore**: (Future implementation)
- **‚öôÔ∏è Admin Settings**: (Future implementation)

### **Enhanced Delete Protection**
When deleting a key or resetting the system:

1. **Re-Authentication**: Touch YubiKey to confirm identity
2. **Multi-Step Confirmation**: Multiple confirmation dialogs
3. **Exact Text Verification**: Must type "DELETE" or "RESET EVERYTHING"
4. **Security Logging**: All actions logged with timestamps
5. **Final Warning**: Last chance to abort

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Features

### **Session Security**
- **Encrypted Storage**: Sessions stored with encryption in localStorage
- **Timeout Protection**: Auto-logout after 30 minutes
- **Activity Tracking**: Updates on every click/keystroke
- **Manual Logout**: Red "Logout" button in top-right when authenticated

### **Attack Prevention**
- **Rate Limiting**: Maximum 3 authentication attempts
- **Temporary Lockout**: 15-minute cooldown after failed attempts
- **Attempt Logging**: All authentication attempts logged
- **Generic Errors**: No information disclosure in error messages

### **Security Logging**
All security events are logged with:
- Timestamp
- Event type (login, logout, key_deleted, etc.)
- User details
- Browser information
- Action results

## üì± Localhost Testing

Since WebAuthn requires HTTPS, localhost testing uses a simulation mode:

### **Simulated Authentication**
- Shows "HTTPS required" message
- 2-second delay to simulate YubiKey interaction
- Creates test session with simulated admin key
- All security features work except actual YubiKey validation

### **Testing Security Features**
You can test all security features on localhost:
- Authentication screen appearance
- Session timeout behavior
- Re-authentication prompts for sensitive operations
- Multi-step confirmations
- Security logging

## üåê Production Deployment

### **HTTPS Requirements**
```apache
# Force HTTPS redirect
RewriteEngine On
RewriteCond %{HTTPS} off
RewriteRule ^(.*)$ https://%{HTTP_HOST}%{REQUEST_URI} [L,R=301]
```

### **Security Headers**
```apache
Header always set X-Frame-Options "SAMEORIGIN"
Header always set X-Content-Type-Options "nosniff"
Header always set X-XSS-Protection "1; mode=block"
Header always set Content-Security-Policy "default-src 'self'"
```

### **Admin Access Logging**
```apache
# Log all admin panel access
<FilesMatch "admin\.html$">
    CustomLog logs/goldeneye_admin_access.log combined
</FilesMatch>
```

## üéØ Usage Instructions

### **For System Owner (You)**

1. **First-Time Setup**:
   - Visit `https://yourdomain.com/goldeneye/admin.html`
   - Insert admin YubiKey when prompted
   - Touch key to authenticate
   - Admin panel becomes available

2. **Daily Usage**:
   - Sessions last 30 minutes
   - Logout button in top-right corner
   - Re-authentication required for dangerous operations

3. **Key Management**:
   - Enroll inheritance keys with descriptive names
   - Test keys regularly to ensure they work
   - Disable/delete keys if compromised

### **For Emergency Access**
If you're locked out:
- Wait 15 minutes for lockout to expire
- Ensure you're using correct admin YubiKey
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify HTTPS is working properly

### **For Inheritors**
- Inheritors use the simple interface at `/goldeneye/`
- They don't need admin access
- Any two enrolled keys can unlock the vault
- No special training required

## üîß Advanced Configuration

### **Timeout Settings**
```javascript
const ADMIN_CONFIG = {
    sessionTimeout: 1800000,    // 30 minutes (adjustable)
    requireReauth: 600000,      // 10 minutes (adjustable)
    maxRetries: 3,              // Failed attempts (adjustable)
    lockoutTime: 900000         // 15 minutes (adjustable)
};
```

### **Security Logging**
Events logged:
- `admin_login` - Successful authentication
- `admin_logout` - Manual or automatic logout
- `auth_failed` - Failed authentication attempt
- `account_locked` - Account locked due to failures
- `key_deleted` - YubiKey deletion
- `system_reset` - Complete data wipe
- `reauth_required` - Re-authentication prompt
- `reauth_success` - Successful re-authentication

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Security Notes

### **Admin Key Management**
- Only enroll trusted admin keys
- Store admin key separately from inheritance keys
- Consider having a backup admin key
- Document admin key location securely

### **Session Security**
- Always logout when finished
- Don't leave admin panel open on shared computers
- Clear browser data if compromised
- Use private/incognito browsing for extra security

### **Backup Security**
- Backup files contain encrypted data only
- Admin authentication protects backup operations
- Store backup IDs securely and separately
- Consider multiple backup locations

### **Incident Response**
If security is compromised:
1. Immediately logout from all sessions
2. Clear browser localStorage
3. Consider system reset if necessary
4. Re-enroll keys with new credentials
5. Review security logs for suspicious activity

## üìû Support

For security issues or lockouts:
- Review security logs in browser console
- Check HTTPS certificate validity
- Verify YubiKey firmware is current
- Test with different browsers if needed

The system is designed to be secure by default while maintaining usability for inheritance scenarios.
